# Welcome to my page!

My name is Yifei Zhang. I am  an incoming Ph.D. student at the [Yale School of Public Health](https://ysph.yale.edu/) Biostatistics Department, supervised by [Prof Yize Zhao](https://www.yizezhao.com/). Before joining Yale, I earned a Master of Science in Statistics and Operations Research from the [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill(UNC) STOR Department](https://stor.unc.edu/), supervised by Prof [Zhengwu Zhang](https://zhengwu.github.io/). Prior to that, I obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in Applied Mathematics from the [University of Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/).

My research interests include high-dimensional data analysis, computational neuroscience, Bayesian data analysis, network analysis, brain connectomics, and machine learning. I am particularly interested in the application of brain connectomics data in deep learning, specifically with diffusion models. Additionally, I have a strong interest in exploring the relationship between Alzheimer’s disease traits and brain connectomics data.

You can find my CV here: [CV](https://yifzhang2000.github.io/_pages/CV_final.pdf).
